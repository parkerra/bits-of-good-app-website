            Hi! My name is Parker Abramson and I'm interested in learning about website
            development with the purpose of making a positive impact. I started learning 
            JavaScript through Hour of Code in middle school, but the first time I actually
            created a substantial project with JavaScript was last semester in the course CS 2340.
            In a group, I helped create a mobile app in React Native and JavaScript for users
            to find, create, and plan on-campus events and club meetings. I had a lot
            of fun creating the app and coding the project was a rewarding experience even though
            the app was never published. This made me want to better learn web development to create
            useful software and websites that are free and publically available.

            <br /> <br /> 

            I'm also interested in many aspects of how the world works ranging from the economy to climate and geography,
            and I often find myself watching YouTube videos and doing research online to learn more about these topics.
            Sometimes it's frustrating to learn about the economy and society because there are many large organizations with
            lots of power not doing anything to help these issues and/or are actively making them worse. So, non-profits
            and other organizations are absolutely essential for improving people's lives, and by creating websites for them, 
            non-profit staff can focus on making a positive difference rather than fiddling with a website.
        </p>

            Plus I have some ideas for websites like a version of GT Scheduler to plan out all 4-years, and 
            actually creating a website for Georgia Tech clubs to track attendance for events and meetings, as well
            as for students to find more clubs since there aren't many clubs active on Engage. And of course I'd be
            excited to create website for non-profits and other organizations with a positive impact as well :D
